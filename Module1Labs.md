# Module 1 Labs

## Introduction

As part of my submission I will add a cover page, but not on a public repo.

## Lab 1 - Git

### Description/Aims

Git is a distributed version control system widely used by the software community to collaborate easily on files. Git is essentially a miniature filesystem that uses snapshots, also known as commit points to keep a history of changes. Git is also distributed meaning that users can share their files easily with each other.

The aims were:

1. All project files used were to be version controlled.
2. Investigations into the ease of use of this tool in a DevOps environment.
3. Ease of integration with other DevOps tools.
4. Ability to make file changes, track and undo those changes.z
5. Readability of file history.
